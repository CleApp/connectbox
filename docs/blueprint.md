## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light sky blue (#87CEEB), reminiscent of clear skies and open communication, but not literally.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF), a desaturated version of the primary color that creates a calm and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) for highlights, important action items and call-to-action buttons, creating a contrast against the blue tones.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The combination provides a clean, readable, and modern aesthetic.
- Use clear and recognizable icons from a simple set, for lost/found categories and report types. Icons should be in the primary color, filled style for active states, and outlined for inactive ones.
- A clean, card-based layout to display lost/found items and reports. Prioritize a prominent search bar and clearly defined categories.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading content and interactive elements to enhance user experience without being distracting.
